    <img src="../images/rumham.png" width="400" height="auto" alt="rumham">
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 10-pound canned ham</li>
                <li>1 hunting knife</li>
                <li>3 1-liter bottles of rum (the cheaper the better)</li>
                <li>1 handgun</li>
                <li>1 box of handgun ammo</li>
                <li>1 bunch of Italian parsley</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Directions:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>De-can ham (for instructions, see back of can).</li>
                <li>Using the hunting knife, carve a hole in the top of the ham wide enough to hold the mouth of a rum bottle.</li>
                <li>Open first rum bottle and upend it into your ham hole. If you made your hole deep enough, it should stand up there on it's own.</li>
                <li>Load gun.</li>
                <li>Open second rum bottle and upend it into your ham hole (the one in your face this time). As the liquid flows into your mouth, swallow at regular intervals.</li>
                <li>Repeat step five until bottle is empty.</li>
                <li>Open third bottle of rum and repeat step six.</li>
                <li>Remove safety from handgun.</li>
                <li>Wait for ham pirates (they may try and steal your ham).</li>
                <li>Shoot ham pirates.</li>
                <li>Reload gun.</li>
                <li>Repeat steps eight through eleven until rum has been fully absorbed into ham, usually about twelve hours.</li>
                <li>Garnish with parsley and serve.</li>
            </ol>
